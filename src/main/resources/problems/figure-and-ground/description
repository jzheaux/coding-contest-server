	You have been hired to work for the Gutenburg Printing Press. The first day on the job, you arrive to find that someone has stolen a few of the metal letters casts from the tray. 
	Some nearby paper has what appear to be random words printed on it. Create a solution that will reveal which words on the page were written by the thief.

	The input will be, first, the set of letters that are left in the tray, then a space, and then a space-delimited set of words. Your solution should return a space-delimited subset of those words which use all and only the missing letters.
	(Note: Include only words which use all the missing letters. Words with duplicate letters are admissable.)

	For example, in the scenario where you open the drawer and see the letters bdefghijklmnopqrsuvwxyz and see the words cat, act, tack, and at, you can proclaim with Sherlock-Holmes-like confidence that the thief wrote the words cat and act, but not tack and at. Thus, your response would be "cat act".
