<p>Consider Venkmann's warning to never cross the streams. Now disregard it.</p>
<p>In this problem, cross the stream of prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...)
 and the stream of fibonacci numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...), creating a solution that,
 given n, will print out the nth prime fibonacci number.</p>
 <p>For example, the first prime fibonacci number is 2, the fifth is 89, and the eighth is 28657.</p>
 <p>The P-F series grows very quickly. While the input will remain low, your solution should support P-F numbers larger than 2 billion.</p>
