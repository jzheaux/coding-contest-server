<p>You have been hired to create a new spreadsheet application (despite the fact that Microsoft and Google command overwhelming market share).
Your application should be able to have cells refer to one another and still evaluate correctly. For example, if cell A1 says "A2 + 1" and cell A2 says "3", then cell A1 should correctly evaluate to "4".
</p>
<p>
Create a solution that, given 9 inputs that represent a 3x3 spreadsheet grid (e.g. the 0th element refers to cell A1, the 1st element refers to A2, the 2nd to A3, the 3rd to B1, etc.),
evaluates all of them, returning a command-delimited list of their values.
</p>
<p>If there is a cycle, print out the word "cycle" instead of the comma-delimited list of values.</p>
<p>
	The format of the input comma-delimited. Each element of an individual expression is space-delimited, e.g.
	a1<space>+<space>2,a2<space>-<space>3<space>*<space>b1, ... etc ...
</p>
<p>NOTE: Don't worry about order of operations. All tests assume left-to-right evaluation.</p>
