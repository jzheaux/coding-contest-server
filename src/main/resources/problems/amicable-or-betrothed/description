<p>Pythagoras the Matchmaker is trying to find a partner for the number 220. Who would be the best match?
Pythagoras adds its proper divisors together and sees that they add to 284 (1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 284).</p>
<p>Curiously, Pythagoras notes that adding the proper divisors (all factors of n other than itself) of 284 remarkably adds to 220.
A match made in heaven!</p>
<p>Let's call such pairs of numbers Amicable Numbers.</p>
<p>There are also numbers whose proper-divisor-sum is one greater than the number's match and vice-versa. For example, 48 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 24 = 76)
and 75 (1 + 3 + 5 + 15 + 25 = 49).</p>
<p>Let's call these Betrothed Numbers.</p>
<p>Create a solution that, given an input n, that outputs n's Amicable Number Pair, if any, or its Betrothed Number Pair, if any or 'none', if neither.</p>
<p>No number can have both an amicable and betrothed number partner; it will only have one, the other, or neither.</p>
