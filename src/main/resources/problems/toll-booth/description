<p>You have been hired to plan for a set of toll booths across an interstate highway. The city wants to 
earn $n total for people that pass through the entire stretch of taxed highway. They also don't want very many toll
booths; however, they are constrained by how much they can charge at each toll booth based on its location.</p>
<p>Design a solution that will take in n, the total number of dollars to reach, followed by a list of numbers that
are the tax they could exact at each toll booth. Your solution should output m, the fewest number of toll booths in the
list that can be used to bring the total to exactly n.</p>
<p>For example, the city wants to charge $10 for driving the entire expanse of highway. They have seven locations where they
could place toll booths; these could respectively charge $7, $2, $2, $2, $2, $2, and $4. Because the city wants to 
charge exactly $10, they will need to place no fewer than 4 of the toll booths (2 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10). In this problem, the
input is "10 7 2 2 2 2 2 4" and the output is "4".</p>
<p>If instead the toll booth charges were $7 $2 $2 $2 $2 $2 $3, then the answer would be 2 toll booths (7 + 3 = 10)</p>
<p>If no combination of toll booths given successfully add up to $n, return -1</p>
